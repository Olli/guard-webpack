# Guard::Webpack [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/guard-webpack.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/guard-webpack)

Guard::Webpack spins up a [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) watcher in a background thread.

## Installation

Please ensure you have [Guard](http://github.com/guard/guard) installed before you continue.

Add the following to your application's Gemfile:

    group :development do
      gem 'guard-webpack'
    end

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Add Guard::Webpack to your Guardfile by running:

    $ guard init webpack

## Usage

Please refer to the [Guard usage doc](http://github.com/guard/guard#readme)

## Example Guardfile

At present, Guard::Webpack assumes you already have Webpack configured via a `webpack.config.js` file. Please refer to [this Webpack tutorial](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto) for help getting that configured.

You can, however, add additional options to your Guardfile, as seen below:

```ruby
guard :webpack, colors: false, config: './config/webpack/development.config.js'
```

## Options

### List of available options

```ruby
d: false                 # development mode turns on debug mode, source maps, and path info, default: false
colors: true             # use colors in displaying webpack output, default: true
progress: true           # display a progress bar for long compiles, default: true
config: 'path_to_config' # define an alternate config file
mode: 'production'       # set up optimizations accordingly. More information on the webpack docs: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/mode/. default: production
```

## Notes on Guard 1.x

Guard::Webpack strives to support older versions of Guard (including the `Guard::Guard`, rather than `Guard::Plugin` syntax. However, support may be limited. Options, as specified above, are not supported for versions of Guard below 2.0.
